Lifespan Estimator
==================

The Lifespan Estimator module is a core component of the Quantum Threat Tracker (QTT).
It generates a primary output of the QTT, which is a threat timeline.
Given a roadmap for particular quantum computing hardware modalities and the
specifications of cryptographic protocols of interest, this module outputs
an estimate of when the cryptographic protocols are predicted to be broken,
along with the expected resource requirements over time.
