Cryptographic Attacks
=====================

This package contains modules related to different cryptographic attacks. 
Each cryptographic attack is a quantum algorithm that can be used to break a specific cryptographic primitive. 
We currently have implementations to estimate quantum resources for the following primitives:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   rsa
   ecc
   dlog
